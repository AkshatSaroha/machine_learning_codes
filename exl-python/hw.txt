Multi-format Data Transformation

Scenario: A college has a CSV file containing student records.
 
Name,Age,Math,Science,English

Mr. Amit,21,70,75,80

Ms. Sneha,20,85,88,82

Ravi,22,65,60,70

Meera,19,90,92,95
 
You need to:

Read data from the CSV file in Python.
Modify each student's data (e.g., increase marks by 5 points).
Store the updated data in an XML file.
Read back the XML file in Python & Prefix Salutation
Save the final data into a JSON file.
 
Step 1: Read CSV
Use the csv module.
Store each student as a dictionary.
 
Step 2: Modify data
Increase each mark (Math, Science, English) by 5 points, but do not exceed 100.
 
Step 3: Write to XML
Create an XML structure like:
 
<Students>
<Student>
<Name>Amit</Name>
<Age>21</Age>
<Marks>
<Math>75</Math>
<Science>80</Science>
<English>85</English>
</Marks>
</Student>

    ...
</Students>
 
 
Step 4: Read XML

Use xml.etree.ElementTree.
Parse XML and load data into a list of dictionaries.
 
===========> Add Salutation
 
Step 5: Save to JSON
Convert final list to JSON.
Save as students.json.
 
 
Final output files
students.xml (updated student records in XML format)
students.json (final JSON data)
